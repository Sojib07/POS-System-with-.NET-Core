A web application where the user can efficiently manage sales information. The user can select products and add quantity. The unit price for each selected product and the total price will be updated in respective fields. The user can then add that information to a bill and save it in the database.
I have used the MySQL server and ADO.Net to store and retrieve all the information. JQuery and JavaScript has been used to make the application interactive and dynamic.
